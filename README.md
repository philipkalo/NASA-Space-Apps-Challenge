This Github repo contains all the Python scripts that were used for the NASA Space Apps Challenge (in the form of Jupyter Notebooks). This consists of a script for the implementation of the Random Forest Classifier, a script for the K-Neighbors Classifier, and a script for the Logistic Regression. The outcomes of each algorithm can be found in the presentation shared.

The goal of this project was to build and train different machine learning classifiers using NASA's Kepler Objects of Interest dataset to predict whether several stellar bodies are exoplanets based on some orbital parameters. The performance of the models was subsequently evaluated using standard machine learning evaluation metrics to determine (and justify) which performs optimally.
